Major Tom reporting in, I believe the Korat Empire 
must have thought that my victory yestersol was 
a fluke because they sent the same ground forces 
at me again. I defeated them just the same. The 
scavengers found a usable power source for the 
communication device. They also found a Plasma 
shotgun for me! It will allow me to fire in 
wider bursts hitting multiple Korats at the 
same time. This should help me if they send 
new forces.
