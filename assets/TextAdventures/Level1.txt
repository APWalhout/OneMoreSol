Major Tom reporting in, the U.S.S. Odyssey has 
crashed landed on Mars after trying to escape 
the newfound threat, the Korat Empire. A majority 
of the crew was killed from the impact of the 
crash, including Captain Maddick. I have 
managed to make contact with Dr. Lao and a 
group of survivors from the research team. 
They have an idea on how to contact earth using 
pieces of the surviving equipment, but it's going 
to take a few Sols. I have built a small 
fortification on the crash site, expecting the 
Korat Forces to send ground troops to take us 
out, hopefully my Plasma pistol is good enough 
for now.
