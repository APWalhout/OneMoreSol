Major Tom reporting in, Dr. Lao and her team got 
the communicator working but due to the 
jamming interference it will require a lot more 
power than she originally planned. She sent out 
the scavengers again. This time, their goal is 
to find one of the Odyssey's backup reactor 
cores. If one of them is still intact, we may 
have a chance of breaking through the jamming 
barrier.
