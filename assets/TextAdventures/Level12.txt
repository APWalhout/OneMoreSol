Major Tom reporting in, another Sol went by, I 
would have thought that high command would 
send someone out to find out what happened to 
us by now. We have not communicated with them 
for almost two weeks. Dr. Lao managed to 
scavenge that huge gun the Major was using, 
she may be able to get it working for me. 
Fingers crossed.
