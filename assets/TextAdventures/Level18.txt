Major Tom reporting in, the scavengers came 
through! They found one reactor core! Dr. Lao
and her team are in the process of getting it 
attached to the communicator. Once they confirm 
everything is working and that using the 
communicator wont kill us all, they will send a 
message to Earth. Hopefully tomorrow! Right now 
I have another wave of bastards to deal with.
