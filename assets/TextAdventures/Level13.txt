Major Tom reporting in, another dead wave of 
Korat at my feet. I wonder if I'll become a 
legend in their culture, the demon lord who 
wrought death and destruction on their species. 
Ahh who cares, I have enough demons in my head 
as it is. Dr. Lao got the weapon working. She 
could only get the overcharge mode to work. 
It does massive damage but it needs an entire 
Sol to cool down. Lets try this puppy out!
