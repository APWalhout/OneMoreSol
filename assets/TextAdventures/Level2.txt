Major Tom reporting in, I have managed to stop 
the first wave of ground troops in their tracks. 
The Korat Empire seems to be a race of feline 
humanoids with technology similar to ours. Dr. 
Lao and the research team have not yet 
established the reasoning as to why they are 
attacking us. They are however continuing their 
research into a communication device that will 
give us contact with Earth. In the meantime, 
they have sent out researchers to scavenge 
equipment for the device and weaponry for me.
