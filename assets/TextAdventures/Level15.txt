Dr. Lao reporting in, the major is beginning to 
lose his mind, no soldier should go through this 
much war and death. Im giving him a shot that 
should relax his mind, hopefully he will be back 
to normal by tomorrow. I also hypothesize the 
Korat must not want their existence reaching the 
outside world which is why they are so relentless 
with trying to kill us.
