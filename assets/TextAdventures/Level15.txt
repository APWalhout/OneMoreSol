Dr. Lao reporting in, the Major is beginning to 
lose his mind, no soldier should go through this 
much war and death. Im giving him a shot that 
should relax his mind, hopefully he will be back 
to normal by tomorrow. I also hypothesize the 
Korat must not want the knowledge of their 
existence reaching the outside world, which 
is why they are so relentless, in regards 
to trying to kill us.
