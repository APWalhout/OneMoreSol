Major Tom reporting in, Im surprised the Korat 
havent attacked us at night, the research team 
thinks they are hibernating but I think they are 
just planning their attacks for the morning. 
Either way, the scavengers have managed to find 
part of the Odysseys main computer, hopefully 
it's not too damaged. They also found a Laser 
rifle that was lodged into the computer. Luckily 
it still works. It fires much quicker than 
either of my plasma weapons.
